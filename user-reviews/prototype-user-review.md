The user evaluation was conducted with Wilhelm Jansson, a fellow computer science student at KTH, the the time of the evaluation the project was in early prototype stage, we had an early version of the search bar that was connected to the kth api. Due to the low amount of features at the time the tasks that we would like to conduct were fairly limited but we started with allow the interviewed to browse around and use the page. It became evident in the beginning that filters werenâ€™t really of such an importance, usually the user wanted to check a specific course, therefore the need for specificity was important, that the user would get what they were looking for. Henceforth our efforts to make the search page highly dynamic were down-prioritized in favor of a slick simplistic page, that was easy to use. We also noticed a behavior of not knowing exactly the last digits of the course, the person would quite often have the first SF16XX, with some letters missing, resulting in a lot of results from the api, we did not visualize these results in a good way initially and having 50+ results in a list required a lot of scrolling. Another decision that we made after noticing this was therefore to only show the first few results as full-results, and then having the rest of the results in a smaller form, more suitable to stacking where only the course-code and its rating would be shown.
